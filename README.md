Creating view transitions on the web has always been difficult. UI transitions between states in single-page apps (SPAs) tends to involve writing significant amount of CSS and custom JavaScript to achieve.

View Transitions API is a new, experimental mechanism for easily creating animated transitions between different DOM states, while also updating the DOM contents in a single step.

Transitioning elements don't need to be the same DOM element, meaning you can create transitions for two different and separate elements in the DOM that are conceptually the same.

Using this feature helps users understand the relationship between the same elements in different pages while making it easier for developers to implement.

The API is in the experimental phase and is only supported from chrome 111 onwards, but sooner than later other browsers will keep up. I am really happy to see these features being implemented in the browser, making the web more and more feel like native apps with silky smooth user experiences.
